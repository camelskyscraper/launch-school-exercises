# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

number = 7

if number
  puts "My favorite number is #{number}."
else
  puts "I don't have a favorite number."
end

# My favorite number is 7
# Any number evaluates as true (actually any value other than false or nil evaluates as true)

# Whoops, forgot to add the double quotes. #puts wraps the output in double quotes. Hmm.. just tried it in irb and I think I had that backwards.
