Exercise:
In the previous exercise, you learned that the while loop returns nil unless break is used. Locate the documentation for break, and determine what value break sets the return value to for the while loop.

Answer:
Ha, looked that up during the last exercise.
On https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.0/doc/syntax/control_expressions_rdoc.html#label-break+Statement
found this syntax
break <return-value> if <expression>
"break accepts a value that supplies the result of the expression it is "breaking" out of"
This can be any value specified, regardless of the expression used to determine the break.
If no value is specified, nil is used.
