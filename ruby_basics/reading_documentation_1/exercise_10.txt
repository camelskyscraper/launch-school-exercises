Exercise:
Locate the ruby documentation for methods File::path and File#path. How are they different?

Answer:
File::path is the class method.
File.path(<path>) returns a string representation of the path.

File#path is the instance method.
<fileobj>.path returns the pathname used to create file as a string.

Hmm... other than one being for the Class and the other for an instance of the class I don't see what the difference is.
