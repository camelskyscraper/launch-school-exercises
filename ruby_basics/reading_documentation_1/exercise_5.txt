Exercise:
Using the ruby documentation, determine how you can write large numbers in a way that makes them easier to read.

Answer:
Source: https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.0/doc/syntax/literals_rdoc.html#label-Numbers
On the Literals page.
Looks like 123E6 would push the decimal point six places right, equalling 123,000,000.
So that's more compact, but not easier to read.
(The opposite direction is 123e-6, equaling 0.000123)
Underscores can be used to visually break up numbers, e.g.
123_456 = 123,456
The underscore can be placed anywhere in the number (not just where a comma might be used). The underscores are simply stripped out.
