Exercise:
Using the ruby documentation, determine what value a while loop returns.

Answer:
From https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.0/doc/syntax/control_expressions_rdoc.html#label-while+Loop
"The result of a while loop is nil unless break is used to supply a value."
I didn't know that break could supply a value.
On the same page:
"break accepts a value that supplies the result of the expression it is "breaking" out of:"
break <value> if <expression>
