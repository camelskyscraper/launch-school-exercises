Exercise:
Using the ruby documentation, determine how you would write a Symbol that represents your name. We aren't looking for a String; we want a Symbol, which is one of ruby's datatypes.

Answer:
:"Kirk Roberts"
:kirk_roberts
:Kirk
"Kirk Roberts".to_sym

A symbol represents a name inside the ruby interpreter.

Interpolation is legal:
:"MyNameIs#{'Kirk' + 'Roberts'}"
