# Use irb to run the following code:

a = [5, 9, 3, 11]
puts a.min

# Find the documentation for the #min method and modify the above program to print the two smallest values in the Array.

puts a.min(2)

# I'm catching onto the pattern here
# also found on http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.0/Array.html#method-i-min
# feels like cheating using ruby 2.4's built-in #min method for Array instances :)
